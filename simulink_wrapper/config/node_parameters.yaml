# This completely embeds the basic structure of a YAML parameter file.
# Note that this could be used for multiple nodes at once: just repeat the following block!
# Eventual namespaces would have to be prepended.
# A comprehensive guide can be found at: https://roboticsbackend.com/ros2-yaml-params/
# Don't forget slashes in names, otherwise stuff won't work!
